# Gomoku-Haskell
Gomoku game made with Haskell. The game is very similar to Connect Four but more complex, in order to win the game you need to connect 5 pieces together in a Go board and instead of dropping a piece down a column each player takes runs placing a piece on the board. 

# Project Tasks
- Build the go board representation/utility functions
- Implement the game logic code
- Add UI to interact with the game
- Add GUI

# Bug backlog
- (Fixed) ~~When simple AI makes a move and the board gets printed, the update is delayed (The tile placed will not appear until the next move)~~

# Extra
- Add save/load functionality
- Add player vs computer with a competent AI algorithm
- Add networking

# Development Notes
- When writing the code try to add a comment on what the code is doing
- When writing a function try and add the type declaration
- When pushing up the code into main branch, write the code in a separate branch and create a pull request instead (For possible code review before merge)
